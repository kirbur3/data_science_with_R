STAT364 Data Science Diagnostics and Problems with Predictors:
-Checked error assumptions, looked for unusual observations, and examined the structure of the model.

-Fitted a regression model and computed/interpreted condition numbers.

-Checked for collinearity issues via vif function.

-Explored whether the removal of the predictors that aren't significant reduces the collinearity.

-Refitted the model with less cases, checked for collinearity and interpreted the results.

-Computed prediction intervals and compared their answers.

STAT364 Data Science Estimation Homework 1:
-Fitted a regression meodel and examined the goodness of fit.

-Looked into which observation has the largest (positive) residual.

-Computed the mean and median of the residuals and the correlation of the residuals with the fitted values and one of the predictors.

-Fitted two different models to the same data: one with the response inside of a log function and the other with a respnse by itself withot a function.

-Compared the regression coefficients of one predictor from each model, interpreted the results, and determined which fit/model was better.

-Fitted multiple models by starting out with the response and one predictor and then addiding on one predictor at a time. Then recorded and plotted the residual standard error and R^2.

-Fitted a model without an intercept term, compared the goodness of fit for this model to the goodness of fit of the model with an intercept.

STAT364 Data Science Final Class Project R:

-Selected a model, checked for large leverage points, outliers, and influential points.

-Examined the structure of the relationship between the predictors and the response.

-Checked model assumptions by looking for collinearity issues, conducting principal component analysis, analyzing the distribution of errors, variance, and whether the data is linearly related.

-Transformed the data and interpreted the results at every step of the project.

STAT364 Data Science Inference, Predictor, and Explanation Homework 2

-Fitted models, computed confidence intervals and a joint confidence region, evaluated models using anova, and interpreted the results.

-Identified the predictors that are statistically significant and analyzed what an increase in one of the predictors would do to the response.

-Predicted responses and confidence intervals and interpreted the results.

-Evaluated models using anova, compared prediction intervals, and looked for anamolous obervations.

-Fitted and compared models with different amounts of predictors, reported the coefficient and significance of the only
