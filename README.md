STAT364 Data Science Diagnostics and Problems with Predictors Homework 3 (R):



-Checked error assumptions, looked for unusual observations, and examined the structure of the model.

-Fitted a regression model and computed/interpreted condition numbers.

-Checked for collinearity issues via vif function.

-Explored whether the removal of the predictors that aren't significant reduces the collinearity.

-Refitted the model with less cases, checked for collinearity and interpreted the results.

-Computed prediction intervals and compared their answers.

STAT364 Data Science Estimation Homework 1:

-Fitted a regression meodel and examined the goodness of fit.

-Looked into which observation has the largest (positive) residual.

-Computed the mean and median of the residuals and the correlation of the residuals with the fitted values and one of the predictors.

-Fitted two different models to the same data: one with the response inside of a log function and the other with a respnse by itself withot a function.

-Compared the regression coefficients of one predictor from each model, interpreted the results, and determined which fit/model was better.

-Fitted multiple models by starting out with the response and one predictor and then addiding on one predictor at a time. Then recorded and plotted the residual standard error and R^2.

-Fitted a model without an intercept term, compared the goodness of fit for this model to the goodness of fit of the model with an intercept.

STAT364 Data Science Final Class Project R:

Note: This project is listed in my resume as "**Predictive Modeling & Transformation Project**".

-Selected a model, checked for large leverage points, outliers, and influential points.

-Examined the structure of the relationship between the predictors and the response.

-Checked model assumptions by looking for collinearity issues, conducting principal component analysis, analyzing the distribution of errors, variance, and whether the data is linearly related.

-Transformed the data and interpreted the results at every step of the project.

STAT364 Data Science Inference, Predictor, and Explanation Homework 2:

-Fitted models, computed confidence intervals and a joint confidence region, evaluated models using anova, and interpreted the results.

-Identified the predictors that are statistically significant and analyzed what an increase in one of the predictors would do to the response.

-Predicted responses and confidence intervals and interpreted the results.

-Evaluated models using anova, compared prediction intervals, and looked for anamolous obervations.

-Fitted and compared models with different amounts of predictors, reported the coefficient and significance of the only predictor kept constant in all the models, and commented on the stability of the effect of that predictor on each model.

-Created different plots and interpreted the meaning of a predictor's coefficients.

STAT364 Data Science Midterm Project (R):

-Fitted a linear model and created multiple plots with linear regression lines.

-Analyzed my results using parameter estimation, significance of each parameter, goodness of fit, hypothesis testing of the whole model, and the confidence intervals of parameters.

-Used anova and determined the goodness of fit to find out which predictor is the most significant and interpreted the results at every step.

STAT364 Data Science Problems with the Error, Transformation, Model Selection, and Shrinkage Methods Homework 4:

-Fitted a model and checked for non-constant variance.

-Determined the right weights in a weighted Least Squares fit and ran transformations.

-Used the Box-Cox method to decide the best transformation on the response and interpreted the results.

-Implemented backward elimination, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Adjusted R^2, and Mallows Cp to select a model.

-Fitted a model, commented on the effect of a predictor on the response, and computed a prediction interval.

-Conducted Principle Component Analysis, selected the correct number of components, explained my reasoning, and predicted the response for the predictors with set values.

-Computed Principal Component Analysis, determined the percentage of variation explained by the first pc and the prominent variables, computed PCA with scaled variables and compared the results, and provided an explanation for the second principal component.
